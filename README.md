# Rant!

Rant is a little project that came about when I wanted to, well, rant about something on Slack and I didn't want to go
to the effort of formatting my rants with the requisite amounts of exclamation marks and emojis. If I did that I would
be crafting a message with intent and that would break me out of the ranting mood and calm me down.

Thus, I built Rant! to accept my raw stream of ranting and insert lots of `!`s `ðŸ¤¬`s and `ðŸ˜¤`s as needed (or unneeded).

Initially it was merely a Slack integration but I decided to open up a little web endpoint as well, coz, why not?
